Despite the hurdles in its character writing and monotonous first 30 hours, this collaboration feels like a culmination of Uchikoshi and Kodaka\'s driving philosophies. Hundred Line\'s joyful and cruel execution of its themes is the linchpin of its quality. The strategy RPG battles are compelling in both gameplay and story. Uchikoshi’s fresh and risky take on his branching narrative framework brings to life world building and heartfelt character moments. But it was Kodaka’s contributions to the main scenario that most surprised me as someone mixed on most of his games. If Danganronpa v3 was an artist\'s celebration and critique on artistic expression, then Hundred Line is a human\'s celebration and critique on humanity. The capacity of people to love and hate. By its final moments I was reduced to a sobbing mess, and that is all the confirmation I need to know that Too Kyo\'s six year ambitions have paid off.','46c87102-94ce-420b-89c0-720d5fa2a789','6d2a9a1e-ff36-4e23-b9ad-b238ca0f1143',8,'2025-04-21',0,'136357fa-15e9-4a0c-95c7-107be1f1dca4'),('5da27d3e-ed5b-4f81-a7a2-b503c1b01e6a','Ai characters characters challenge dialogue progression immersion multiplayer progression creativity dialogue storyline balance mechanics art difficulty controls controls dialogue art characters dialogue challenge combat environment storyline dialogue multiplayer soundtrack environment replayability challenge graphics tutorial design controls dialogue environment balance challenge storyline difficulty ai challenge combat soundtrack balance controls multiplayer exploration.','6722c89e-6cfa-4a52-94d4-3f4269f6824b','9f3e1b22-42f7-4b99-9c6c-458c68b7499a',7.2,'2025-04-21',0,'9650ae28-4b79-46b6-b5f3-792d0dc71ee4'),('60a5b4b7-f1b7-4951-9de2-fb0e63586e3f','It’s always a delight to discover what will end up being one of my favorite video games in real time, but The Hundred Line did it.

In The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-, the visual novel and combat parts hit that target, but the social and resource-gathering elements don’t. And those parts happen to eat up a ton of extra time that grows increasingly obnoxious as you explore the narrative. That stuff is padding that loses more and more substance the longer you play and the more you do a thing I can\'t really talk about here.
